## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
-   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) for interacting with the Cloudflare platform.
### Installation & Local Development
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chromabin.git
    cd chromabin
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Vite frontend and the Wrangler development server for the backend worker concurrently.
    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
## üìÅ Project Structure
The project is organized into three main directories:
-   `src/`: Contains all the frontend React application code, including pages, components, hooks, and styles.
-   `worker/`: Contains the backend Cloudflare Worker code, built with Hono. This is where API routes and business logic reside.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces that are shared between the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.
## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
